## About me

I'm a 2nd year student of Computer Science. I'm interested in programming and machine learning.

Apart from that, I get a new hobby every other week, but some of those I stuck with are photography (especially street photography), cooking (italian and south-east asian cuisine) and mountain hiking (everywhere and anywhere).
